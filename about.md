## ABOUT US

Lower Polk Neighbors is a neighborhood association, made up of both residents and merchants, in the lower part of San Francisco's Polk Gulch district. 

We meet to discuss neighborhood issues and then follow up on those discussions with action. Our issues are crime, cleanliness, beautification, and strengthening of our community: Since we began meeting in late 2001, we have begun a Lower Polk tree planting program; we have worked with the Department of Public Works and others to address the grime, graffiti and garbage on our streets; and we have worked with the San Francisco Police Department on remaining quality-of-life issues. We have also met with business owners to address crime and cleanliness issues related to their businesses; we have met with nonprofit low-income housing developers to help plan their projects in the neighborhood; we have put together a community court whereby those who commit quality-of-life offenses are sentenced by a jury of their peers to pay a fine to or to do community service in the neighborhood; and we have organized neighborhood crime walks. 

We also invite elected and other high-ranking officials to speak at our general meetings. Guests have included:

* Mayor Gavin Newsom (2004-2011)
* District 3 Supervisor Aaron Peskin (2005-2009)
* District 3 Supervisor David Chiu (2009-incumbent)
* District 6 Supervisor Chris Daly (2001-2011)
* District 9 Supervisor Tom Ammiano (1994-2008)
* District 11 Supervisor Sophie Maxwell (2000-2011)
* District Attorney Kamala Harris (2004-2011)
* Chief of Police Heather Fong (1997-2009)
* Fire Chief Joanne Hayes-White (2004-current)
