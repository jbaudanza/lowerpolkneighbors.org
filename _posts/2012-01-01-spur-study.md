title: New study from San Francisco Planning and Urban Research Association
---

This analysis only considers part of the picture: whether housing will be safe to occupy considering earthquake damage to structures. It does not consider other damage or cascading consequences, such as damage to utilities or structural damage from fires following the earthquake. The factors that contribute to whether residents choose to stay or leave after a disaster are complex, and the structural safety of residences is only one piece of information, albeit an important one. This should be kept in mind while reviewing the following figures, which only represent that one piece. The analysis makes clear that housing in every San Francisco neighborhood would be damaged heavily by a magnitude 7.2 earthquake.
