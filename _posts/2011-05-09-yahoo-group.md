We have a new communication tool and you can now through yahoo groups get access to this LPN utility. 

#### What is it and what is it good for?
It can be seen as an extension of our LPN website with the added function for members to be able to post information / files / pictures for other members to see and respond to. This can be helpful when a member has a presentation/response /issue that is more suitable to present in writing (versus verbally at a meeting) due to complexity, time restrains etc. 

#### How does it work?
When a member post a message / upload a file / picture (a file can f. ex. be a powerpoint presentation) all members will receive an automated e-mail with the forwarded new message or the information that a new file / picture is uploaded and available . Members can also go to the actual site and check for updates. A link will always be available on our LPN website for easy access. It's safe and trustable, hosted by yahoo and it's hassle-free to unsubscribe and leave this utility at any time. To learn more or join please visit:
