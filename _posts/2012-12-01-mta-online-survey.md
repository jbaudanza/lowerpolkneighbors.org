*Message from MTA:* Online Survey - Available until December 28. We want to know what you think about our Polk Street proposals! Please take some time to review the Polk Street Overview and Design Alternatives (pdf), and then complete our Polk Street Preferred Alternatives Survey (surveymonkey). The survey takes around 20 minutes to complete and includes the proposed designs featured at the December community meetings.This project seeks to implement aesthetic and safety improvements for all users of Polk Street between McAllister and Union Streets. In accordance with the City's Transit First policy, improvements will primarily be focused on people who walk, use transit and ride a bicycle along Polk Street. The project is funded by Proposition B General Obligation Bonds.Complete info and survey can be found by following this link:
