title: Warning from SFPD

*From SFPD:*

At yesterday's Police Forum meeting, Captain Garrity of Tenderloin Police Station alerted us (The Castro St. 'stop the violence' project) to a series of incidents occurring at Bank of America's ATMs where unsuspecting victims are walking away with their cash and cards, but are not responding to a final prompt on the ATM asking if they would like another transaction. This allows watching criminals to slip in, respond YES, then withdraw on the victim's account without re-entering the account password.

Tenderloin Station has a number of victims of this type of crime at the Market and Powell BofA ATMs, and this may be the case at other ATMs around the city. Apparently some ATMs do require the re-entry of the password, but some do not.

PLEASE just be sure any ATM you use has returned to the original welcome screen and that you have your cash and card before leaving any machine. If you observe suspicious people hanging around external ATMs or in ATM vestibules consider using an alternative location!  If you do become a victim of this type of crime please file a report with SFPD immediately.  It's the best way to insure you will have your money refunded to you and we can catch these guys.
