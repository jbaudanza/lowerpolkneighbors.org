title: New study from Community Action Plan for Seismic Safety
---
Time is of the essence in preparing for earthquakes in  San Francisco. A  significant Bay Area  earthquake two  to   three  times as  strong  as  the 1989  Loma  Prieta  earthquake is likely  to  occur within  the next  thirty years. And  after  that  earthquake, another earthquake  will  be  looming on  the horizon.  San Francisco will  suffer  terribly  from   these  coming earthquakes, primarily due to  the collapse  or  extensive damage  to many buildings that  were  built  before building  codes contained modern earthquake design  requirements. The suffering will  not be  limited to loss  of life  and injuries, but to  dramatic  losses  of  affordable  housing, character defining buildings,  business, tourism,   and  much  more. Demographics  will  shift.  Resources will  run out.  Public  confidence  in government will  be  shaken,  as San Franciscans question  why the codes and standards necessary to  protect their homes and their community  were not in  place.  In  even  a moderate  earthquake, San Francisco will  be  terribly  impacted. These impacts have   been confirmed by  the extensive studies performed under the Community Action  Plan  for Seismic Safety  (CAPSS) program.
